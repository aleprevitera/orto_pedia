# Latarjet vs. Bankart per l'instabilità anteriore della spalla: quale procedura scegliere?

!!! question "Domanda"
    Qual è la procedura chirurgica più efficace nel ridurre la recidiva di instabilità anteriore della spalla: riparazione artroscopica di Bankart o procedura di Latarjet?

!!! abstract "Risposta breve"
    La procedura di Latarjet è significativamente superiore: riduce il rischio di recidiva di 3-4 volte rispetto a Bankart. Tuttavia, presenta un profilo di complicanze maggiore (infezioni, ematomi). La scelta dipende dal paziente: Latarjet per atleti e giovani ad alto rischio; Bankart per pazienti selezionati con basso rischio di recidiva.

!!! info "Evidenze chiave"
    - **Recidiva di instabilità** (10/10 paper concordano): Latarjet 1.6–3.5% vs. Bankart 6.6–16.1%. Il rapporto di rischio è 3.08–4.0 a favore di Latarjet. Negli atleti, questa differenza è ancora più marcata (1.6% vs. 16.1% nel follow-up a 4 anni).
    - **Instabilità soggettiva** (1/10 paper): 21% con Latarjet vs. 50% con Bankart+remplissage, ma senza differenza in dislocazioni obiettive.
    - **Revisioni chirurgiche** (3/10 paper): Bankart richiede più revisioni per recidiva (38/45 revisioni totali in uno studio su atleti); Latarjet ne richiede meno (7/45).
    - :warning: **Complicanze totali**: dati contraddittori. Un paper riporta il 47% meno complicanze con Bankart, mentre altri mostrano Latarjet con più ematomi e infezioni (75% più ematomi, infezioni a 1–2 pazienti per coorte). La qualità metodologica degli studi è eterogenea (retrospettivi, livello 3).
    - :warning: **Perdita di rotazione esterna**: Latarjet causa 11° di perdita vs. 19° con Bankart, ma questo dato proviene da un solo studio a lungo termine (17 anni).

!!! tip "Bottom line clinica"
    **Preferire Latarjet in**: atleti, giovani pazienti, instabilità traumatica significativa, primo episodio ad alto rischio di recidiva. **Considerare Bankart in**: pazienti anziani, bassa compliance riabilitativa, basso rischio di recidiva (first-time dislocation selezionato), desiderio di evitare il rischio di ematoma/infezione. **Sequenza operativa**: valutare il deficit osseo (>20–25% richiede Latarjet); in caso di dubbio, optare per Latarjet. **Follow-up**: rivalutare a 3–5 anni. Se instabilità, convertire a Latarjet.
