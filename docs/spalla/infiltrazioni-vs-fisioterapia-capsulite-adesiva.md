# Infiltrazioni di corticosteroidi vs fisioterapia nella capsulite adesiva: effetto tempo-dipendente

!!! question "Domanda"
    Le iniezioni di corticosteroidi sono superiori alla fisioterapia nel trattamento dell'adhesive capsulitis della spalla, e questa superiorità persiste nel tempo?

!!! abstract "Risposta breve"
    Gli steroidi iniettivi offrono benefici significativi nel breve termine (6 settimane) rispetto alla sola fisioterapia, ma questo vantaggio scompare entro 12-26 settimane. La combinazione steroide + fisioterapia è superiore a entrambi gli approcci isolati nel breve termine, con convergenza dei risultati nel lungo termine.

!!! info "Evidenze chiave"
    - **Vantaggio short-term degli steroidi** (5/10 paper concordano): A 6 settimane, le iniezioni di corticosteroidi producono effetti medi-grandi su dolore e ROM rispetto alla fisioterapia sola (Blanchard 2010; Kraal 2018; Anjum 2019). Riduzione del dolore mediano da 8 a 2 su scala 0-10 (Bateman 2014). Tuttavia, una RCT (Kumar 2017, 41 pazienti) contesta questo: il gruppo fisioterapia sola ha ottenuto maggiore ROM di abduzione (78,7° vs 60°).
    
    - **Scomparsa del vantaggio a lungo termine** (6/10 paper concordano): A 12-26 settimane, gli effetti si equiparano (Blanchard: effetto passa da medio a piccolo; Kraal 2018: nessuna differenza a 26 settimane; Shin 2013: nessuna differenza a 24 settimane; Anjum 2019: nessuna differenza oltre 3 mesi). A 52 settimane, persiste solo un piccolo vantaggio per gli steroidi (Blanchard 2010).
    
    - **Superiorità della combinazione terapeutica** (2/10 paper direct): Steroide + fisioterapia > fisioterapia sola nel breve termine (Kraal 2018: migliore SPADI e ROM a 6-12 settimane; Anjum 2019: 45,61% vs 40,46% di miglioramento del dolore a 3 mesi), ma convergenza a 26 settimane.
    
    - :warning: **Disaccordo critico su monoterapia steroidea**: Tang 2024 afferma che gli steroidi soli migliorano significativamente senza benefici aggiuntivi dalla fisioterapia (n=29), contraddicendo Kraal 2018. Inoltre, Kumar 2017 riporta paradossalmente migliore ROM con fisioterapia sola—possibile bias nel disegno retrospettivo.
    
    - :warning: **Limite metodologico**: 4/10 paper non confrontano direttamente steroidi vs fisioterapia (Shin 2013 vs farmaci; Lim 2014 vs ialuronate; Pretorius 2023 vs PRP; Prestgaard 2015 vs placebo).

!!! tip "Bottom line clinica"
    **Raccomandazione**: Nei primi 6 settimane, la combinazione steroide intra-articolare + fisioterapia è il gold standard per controllo rapido del dolore e guadagno ROM, soprattutto in fase acuta-intermedia. La fisioterapia sola rimane efficace ma con timeline più lenta. Non utilizzare steroidi come monoterapia oltre 6 settimane: il vantaggio scompare entro 3 mesi. Oltre le 12 settimane, il follow-up deve focalizzarsi sulla compliance fisioterapica, poiché la progressione dipende
