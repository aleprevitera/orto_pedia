# Efficacia della decompressione subacrominale artroscopica nel trattamento della sindrome da conflitto subacromiale

!!! question "Domanda"
    La decompressione subacrominale artroscopica è più efficace della terapia conservativa o della chirurgia placebo nel ridurre il dolore e migliorare la funzione della spalla nei pazienti con sindrome da impingement subacrominale?

!!! abstract "Risposta breve"
    **La decompressione subacrominale artroscopica NON è efficace.** Con alta certezza metodologica, la chirurgia non supera il placebo chirurgico né la terapia eserciziale nel ridurre il dolore o migliorare la funzione della spalla. I benefici clinici sono assenti o non raggiungono la minima differenza clinicamente importante.

!!! info "Evidenze chiave"
    - **Vs placebo chirurgico (9/10 paper concordano):** differenza di dolore a 1 anno MD -0.26 (IC 95% -0.84 a 0.33) e a 6 mesi MD 0.07 (IC 95% -0.51 a 0.64); differenza di funzione 2.8 punti, ben sotto il cutoff clinicamente importante di 8.3 punti. Nessun beneficio sostenuto a 5 anni.
    - **Vs terapia eserciziale (8/10 paper concordano):** a 1 anno dolore MD -1.01 (IC 95% -1.60 a -0.42), statisticamente significativo ma clinicamente irrilevante; funzione senza differenze clinicamente importanti a 2 e 5 anni.
    - **Ritorno al lavoro (1 paper):** nessun vantaggio della chirurgia vs placebo o esercizio a 5 anni.
    - :warning: **Eccezione controversa:** 1 studio del 1999 (Brox, pre-era placebo) riporta superiorità della chirurgia, probabilmente viziato da bias e confondimento; tutti gli RCT controllati placebo successivi (2017-2021) contraddicono questo dato.

!!! tip "Bottom line clinica"
    **Raccomandazione:** La decompressione subacrominale artroscopica non deve essere offerta come prima linea o routine nei pazienti con sindrome da impingement. **Approccio consigliato:** (1) Terapia conservativa strutturata con esercizi terapeutici di rinforzo della cuffia dei rotatori e stabilizzatori scapolari; (2) se fallimento dopo 12 settimane, considerate imaging avanzato (RM) per escludere rotture masive; (3) la chirurgia è giustificata SOLO in casi selezionati con patologia strutturale significativa (rottura massiva, osteofiti severi) non responsiva a conservativa. Evitare la artroscopia diagnostica isolata e la decompressione "di routine."
