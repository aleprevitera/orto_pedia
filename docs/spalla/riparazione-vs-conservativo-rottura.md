# Riparazione chirurgica vs trattamento conservativo nella lesione della cuffia dei rotatori: quale scegliere?

!!! question "Domanda"
    La riparazione chirurgica della cuffia dei rotatori è più efficace del trattamento conservativo nel migliorare gli outcomes funzionali e clinici?

!!! abstract "Risposta breve"
    No: la chirurgia non è superiore alla terapia conservativa per outcomes funzionali complessivi, ma offre benefici clinici specifici (riduzione dolore, miglioramento ROM). La scelta dipende dall'età, dalla dimensione della lesione e dalle aspettative funzionali del paziente. I tassi di re-lesione chirurgica variano dal 10-90% a seconda delle caratteristiche della tear.

!!! info "Evidenze chiave"
    - **Efficacia comparabile** (4/10 paper concordano): La meta-analisi Ryösä su 252 pazienti e lo studio Lee su 357 pazienti non rilevano differenze clinicamente significative tra chirurgia e conservativa, soprattutto in pazienti >50 anni.
    
    - **Re-lesioni elevate post-chirurgia** (5/10 paper): I tassi variano significativamente con la dimensione: piccole lesioni 6-34%, medie 20-36%, grandi 20-40%, massicce 57-73%. Lo studio di Park (n=25) documenta il 36%, il UKUFF (n=273) il 46.4% (artroscopico) e 38.6% (open).
    
    - **Anziani >75 anni** (3/10 paper): Meng (n=311) e Park (n=25) mostrano miglioramenti clinici significativi con chirurgia, ma re-lesioni elevate (26-36%), particolarmente in lesioni grandi. Tuttavia, Hsieh (n=671) non evidenzia differenze di re-lesione tra anziani e giovani.
    
    - **Terapia conservativa viabile** (2/10 paper): Lee documenta progressione tear al 6.7% con conservativa vs 9.6% di re-lesione con chirurgia. Sambandam la raccomanda in pazienti anziani con basse demande funzionali.
    
    - :warning: **Eterogeneità metodologica**: Ryösä include solo 3 RCT (252 pazienti totali); molti studi sono retrospettivi osservazionali. UKUFF è RCT ma confronta tecniche chirurgiche, non conservativa. Definizione di "outcome funzionale" varia tra studi.

!!! tip "Bottom line clinica"
    **Raccomandazione operativa:** Iniziare sempre con trattamento conservativo (fisioterapia strutturata, gestione dolore) indipendentemente dall'età, monitorando progressione per 3-6 mesi. Indicare chirurgia in pazienti <65 anni con lesioni medie-grandi, sintomi persistenti e alte demande funzionali, oppure in anziani con dolore severo e aspettativa di vita >5 anni, consigliando il paziente su re-lesioni 26-40%. Evitare chirurgia in pazienti con bassa compliance riabilitativa, comorbidità elevate o funzione preoperatoria minimale. Dopo chirurgia, reabilitazione precoce non aumenta re-lesioni (p=0.31 in Mazuquin). Monitorare con imaging se progredisce con conservativa.
