# Gestione della lussazione acromioclavicolare di tipo III: chirurgia vs conservativa

!!! question "Domanda"
    La gestione chirurgica della lussazione acromioclavicolare di tipo III produce risultati funzionali superiori rispetto al trattamento conservativo?

!!! abstract "Risposta breve"
    No. La stragrande maggioranza degli studi concorda che il trattamento conservativo e quello chirurgico producono risultati funzionali equivalenti a lungo termine. Il trattamento chirurgico comporta complicanze più frequenti, recupero più lento e tassi di revisione più elevati, senza vantaggi funzionali significativi. Il trattamento conservativo rimane l'opzione di prima linea per la maggior parte dei pazienti.

!!! info "Evidenze chiave"
    - **Esiti funzionali identici** (5/10 paper): Score di Constant, UCLA e Larsen sono sovrapponibili tra chirurgia e conservativa a medio-lungo termine (follow-up 18-20 anni inclusi). Nessuna differenza statisticamente significativa nell'osteoartrosi postoperatoria.
    
    - **Chirurgia comporta costi biologici** (4/10 paper): Tasso di complicanze significativamente più alto con chirurgia (erosione acromiale, osteolisi, calcificazioni, necessità di rimozione della placca). Il recupero è più lento e i tassi di revisione sono elevati.
    
    - **Successo conservativo superiore all'80%** (2/10 paper): Il trattamento conservativo ha successo in oltre l'80% dei casi senza necessità di intervento. Anche il dolore persistente tende a essere minore nei pazienti operati, ma la differenza non è conclusiva.
    
    - **Tra le tecniche chirurgiche: suture anchor vs hook plate** (2/10 paper): Se si opera, le suture anchor (SA) mostrano migliore efficacia clinica e sicurezza rispetto alle placche a gancio (HP). La ricostruzione del legamento coracoclavicolare supera la stabilizzazione con hook plate.
    
    - :warning: **Ritorno all'attività non definitivamente provato**: L'evidenza su ritorno allo sport/attività superiore con chirurgia è insufficiente. Un paper suggerisce ritorno più rapido al lavoro con tight rope, ma gli esiti funzionali rimangono equivalenti dopo 12 mesi.
    
    - :warning: **Eterogeneità metodologica**: Diversi studi utilizzano outcome differenti e popolazioni specifiche (atleti vs non-atleti), riducendo la generalizzabilità.

!!! tip "Bottom line clinica"
    **Raccomandazione: trattamento conservativo come prima linea.** Iniziare con immobilizzazione, fisioterapia progressiva e rinforzo. La chirurgia va riservata a fallimenti conservativi selettivi, pazienti giovani/atleti con instabilità persistente dopo 3-6 mesi e lesioni associate complesse. Se si opera, preferire ricostruzione del legamento coracoclavicolare o suture anchor rispetto a hook plate. Aspettare il fallimento conservativo documentato (dolore cronico, instabilità radiografica, disabilità funzionale) prima di indicare chirurgia, poiché i risultati funzionali finali saranno comunque equivalenti ma senza il rischio di complicanze.
