# Farmaci vs non-farmaci per il dolore lombare cronico

!!! question "Domanda"
    Qual è l'efficacia relativa degli approcci farmacologici versus non-farmacologici nel trattamento del dolore lombare cronico non specifico?

!!! abstract "Risposta breve"
    Gli approcci non-farmacologici (esercizio, terapie comportamentali, manipolazione manuale) sono superiori per la disabilità funzionale e gli outcomes a lungo termine, mentre i farmaci producono solo piccoli effetti transitori sul dolore acuto con rischi significativi. Un approccio multimodale combinato è lo standard di cura.

!!! info "Evidenze chiave"
    - **Farmaci hanno efficacia limitata e transitoria** (10/10 paper concordano): NSAIDs e miorilassanti mostrano piccoli effetti solo per il dolore acuto; paracetamolo non è superiore al placebo; gli oppioidi sono efficaci nel breve termine ma presentano alta dipendenza e efficacia minima a lungo termine. Nessun farmaco ha evidenza di alta/moderata certezza (Cochrane 2023).
    - **Esercizio terapeutico è consistentemente efficace** (9/10 paper concordano): riduce dolore e disabilità sia negli adulti che negli anziani; effetti mantengono nel tempo. È l'intervento non-farmacologico con miglior supporto.
    - **Terapie comportamentali (CBT, MBSR, ACT) funzionano alterando la percezione del dolore** (5/10 paper): riducono paura-evitamento, migliorano qualità della vita, migliorano disabilità funzionale. Meccanismo diverso dai farmaci, quindi complementare.
    - **Manipolazione manuale e acupuntura hanno efficacia moderata** (7/10 paper): benefici confermati per riduzione dolore e funzione; evidenza minore per massaggio terapeutico e ultrasuoni (no evidenza sostanziale).
    - :warning: **Bassa qualità generale di evidenza negli anziani** (3/10 paper): Meta-analisi su over-65 riporta qualità "bassa o molto bassa" per entrambi gli approcci; serve ricerca più robusta in questa popolazione.

!!! tip "Bottom line clinica"
    **Nel dolore lombare cronico non-specifico, iniziare SEMPRE con esercizio strutturato + educazione del paziente.** Aggiungere CBT o MBSR per migliorare outcomes funzionali e ridurre disabilità. I farmaci (FANS, non paracetamolo) sono ausiliari per il dolore acuto severo, MAI prima linea. Evitare oppioidi salvo eccezioni rare. Manipolazione manuale e acupuntura possono integrarsi se esercizio non è tollerato. Rivalutare ogni 4-6 settimane; il miglioramento funzionale (non solo analgesia) è l'obiettivo primario.
